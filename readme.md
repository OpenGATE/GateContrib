**GateContrib**

**Warning** - This is a *user-oriented*, collaborative repository of Gate examples. The [OpenGate collaboration](http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/) is not responsible of any contents.

**PLEASE INSTALL GIT-LFS FIRST: this is required !**
This repository contains data (binary files), stored with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) extension. For most modern Linux distributions there is a standard package for this, e.g. for Ubuntu/Debian do: `apt install git-lfs`. (If your OS does not have a standard package for git-lfs, then follow the installation instructions on the [git-lfs GitHub page](https://git-lfs.github.com/).) With git-lfs successfully installed, clone the `GateContrib` repository with the command `git lfs clone https://github.com/OpenGATE/GateContrib.git`. If you omit the `lfs` from the `git clone` command then the large binary files may not be downloaded correctly.

[Gate](https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate), based on [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch) library, allows to perform various Monte-Carlo simulations in the field of **medical physics**. [Gate](https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate) can be used in numerous ways and for a lot of different applications. This repository contains [Gate](https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate) simulation examples, mostly provided by users, in order to help sharing knowledge.

**How to contribute ?**
* Prepare your example as a pull-request. Clone this repository in your github account, commit your example in your cloned repository, then ask us to integrate your proposal via the "New pull request" button. 
* Your simulation must be in a separate folder. You can put it in the folder `imaging` or `dosimetry` or `misc`. 
* Example **must** contains:
  * a `readme.md` file that describe the example, the authors, the date and Gate version
  * 3 folders `mac/` `data/` `output/`. The first will contains all macros (`.mac` files), the second all data files needed as input for the simulations. Results should be written in the `output/` folder. 
  * Simulation should be run by a command such as `Gate mac/main.mac` 
* It is also possible to contribute via **analysis tools**. If you developed a killer python script or C++ code useful for Gate simulation, feel free to share it here !
