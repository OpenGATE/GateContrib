\section{Learning ARF neural network}

Four datasets have been simulated for the four radionuclides. Each
simulation tracked $\num{e10}$ primary photons, sampled from the
energy distribution of the radionuclide. The simulation use one single
SPECT head and record photon incoming at the collimator entrance. It
lead to a dataset of about 2.3 GB of data. Russian Roulette factor is
set to 100. It tooks around 6 days of computation (on a single core).

% mac/main_dataset.mac

Neural networks for all four radionuclides were trained on those
dataset with ``config-nn-rr100-v4.json'' parameter file: 3 layers, 400
neurons by layer, 500 epoch max, 5000 batch size, 200 batch by
epoch. It tooks about 2 hours.

\section{Evaluation with one example}

The reference simulation was as follows. CT thorax image resampled to
$4 \times 4 \times 4$ mm$^3$, with patient background removed (set to
Air). The density tolerance for Gate was set to $1 g/cm^3$ (very few
material). Physics list was \verb+emstandard_opt1+, cut was set to high
values in order to not track electron, except in the SPECT
crystal. The source was a voxelized source composed of 3 spheres of
about 78, 24, 20 mm diameters, with activity of 1, 1.5, 3
(normalized). About $\num{e10}$ decays was simulated for all
radionuclides (and $\num{e11}$ for Lu177), see table.

Reference analog simulation is long, more than 10 days for about
$\num{e10}$ decays. Because ARF simulation is a Variance Reduction
Technique, less primary particles is needed to reach similar
uncertainty. However, there is no simple rule to set this number. A
rule of thumb is 10 times less (see efficiency in the next
section). To compare to the analog reference simulation, image from
ARF simulation must be scaled to the targeted number of primary.

Speed up have been computed as a mean on each slice, for all voxels
with more than 10\% max counts. Computation time is extracted from the
stats.txt file and uncertainties were computed by voxel.

\section{Conclusion}

For high activity energy windows (primary peaks), speed up is between
16 to 50, and can reach up around 200 for low activity peaks. Speed up
is better for low activity energy windows (scatter).
