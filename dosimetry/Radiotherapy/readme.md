## Proton therapy

   **Example 4** : Beam optics simulation in vacuum for a pencil beam + depth-dose profile in water. A root macro is provided to analysis the produced phase space files.

   **Example 5** : Treatment plan simulation of proton active scanning beam delivery (TPSPencilBeam source). A root macro is provided to analysis the produced phase space files.

   **Example 6** : Proton pencil beam in heterogeneous phantom (water, bones, Lung) with Pencil Beam Scanning source: comparison between dose to water and dose to dose to medium.

## Carbon ion therapy

   **Example 1** : Carbon beam in water tank or in patient CT image. Output is a 3D dose distribution map (with associated statistical uncertainty) and map of produced C11.

## Photon/electron therapy

   **Example 2** : Photon beam in patient CT image. 3D dose distribution map (with associated uncertainty). Two different navigators are tested NestedParameterized and Regionalized, with two number of materials.

   **Example 3** : Photon beam in patient CT image with IMRT irradiation. 100 slices with different MLC positions.

   **Example 7** : Example to use repeater/mover and both at the same time.

   **Example 8** : Photon beam from a Linac into a box with water/alu/lung. See Figure4 from [Jan et al PMB 2011].

   **Example 9** : Electron beam from a Linac into a box with water/alu/lung. See Figure5 from [Jan et al PMB 2011].

## Radiography

   **Example 10** : Radiography of a thorax phantom. Outputs are 3D dose distribution maps computed with the classical method and the accelerated (TLE) method.

## Changing dose rate

   **Example 11** : To change the number of primaries at each run

## Test npy /root output with phase space
   **Example 12**: linac phase space with npy input/output
